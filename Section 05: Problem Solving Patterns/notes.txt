"FREQUENCY COUNTERS"
====================
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the ned for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

    Example: 
    write a function called 'same', which accepts two arrays. The function should return tru if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the same array. The frequency of values must be the same.
    same([1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 9]) // true
    same([1, 2, 3], [1, 9]) // false
    same([1, 2, 1], [4, 4, 1]) // false (must be same frequency)
